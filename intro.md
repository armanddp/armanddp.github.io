Aweh! Hello World! Save the date! Or, however you want to phrase it—mark your calendars for the 16th!

Every journey begins with a single step. But the best journeys then break into a run...

We're super stoked to invite you for a mission around the Hout Bay mountains, and to hang around sweaty afterwards for an early intro to our vision for Clubhouse—a space for our trail and mountain running community in Cape Town to connect and hang out.

What: A 5km, 15km and 30km run around Hout Bay. We’ll share the routes before.   
Who: This event is for MATES, Dawgs, Chicks who Trail, Tuesday Trail Runners, and anyone else in the area (even VOB members are welcome).  
Where: The South Yeaster, Hout Bay  
When: 16th of March, 2024 (30km @ 7am, 15km @ 8am and the 5km at @ 8.30am )

What is the Clubhouse?

Running may be a solitary activity, but it's the sense of community that fuels our passion. We're fortunate to have such epic and vibrant communities passionate about running the beautiful mountains of Cape Town. Yet, for a while we felt like something was missing. Since the Vine closed,  we've missed our hub — a home base to hang out when we're not on the trails.

Our vision is to create just that: a clubhouse, a meeting point for our people, the runners. It's intended not just as a spot to start and finish runs, but as a kiff space to connect, foster connections, share stories, discover new routes, celebrate achievements, display your 13 Peaks photos, or watch our friends triumph or puke) in race day live streams together, all over a coffee or a beer. 

A key objective of the Clubhouse is to serve as a vehicle to actively engage with the local communities to provide everyone the opportunity to enjoy our mountains and give local running talent an opportunity to grow and shine.

During the week, the clubhouse will be a place to relax, co-work, eat, meet, and get hold of running nutrition and other essentials . It will also serve as a venue for hosting events, talks, film premieres, socials, and sponsored events—all in the spirit of the Clubhouse.  

But it all starts with a run. Be there, or be square. Get involved. 

A massive shout-out to Innes Smith. Innes has been a huge inspiration for the Clubhouse and someone 
who has left an indelible mark on our community. We miss the Vine, so we thought we'd have to do something about it. We considered naming it the Innes Smith Clubhouse, but that sounded too much like a memorial—and Innes is very much alive and well. We hope to carry forward some of your generosity, sharing, and adventurous spirit with the Clubhouse.
